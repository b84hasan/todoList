# To-Do List App

This is a very small To-Do List app designed to implement the learnings of Node.js, Express, and general JavaScript. The project serves as a practical application of these technologies, featuring endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting todo items. The app stores todo data in-memory and also includes functionality to save data to files for persistence across restarts. Each todo item has a title, description, and a unique autogenerated ID.

## Features

- Create a new todo item
- Retrieve all todo items
- Retrieve a specific todo item by ID
- Update an existing todo item by ID
- Delete a todo item by ID
